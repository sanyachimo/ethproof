# ETH Proof Beginner Course Submission - Assessment

This repository contains my submission for the ETH Proof Beginner Course offered by Metacrafters.

## Overview

The project is centered around a Solidity-based program designed to facilitate token management. Users can create tokens and perform operations like minting and burning token values from their token balances.

## Usage

To utilize the program effectively after compiling the code, adhere to the following steps:

1. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network.

2. For token minting, furnish the designated address along with the desired value in the 'minting' section.

3. To burn tokens, provide the relevant address and the value to be burned in the 'burning' section.

4. To inquire about the token balance of a specific address, input the address in the 'balance' section.

## Important Points

1. Ensure that any provided values are strictly positive.

2. It is imperative to verify that the value specified for burning tokens is not surpassing the available balance.
